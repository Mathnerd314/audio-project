Excellent — let’s do a frequency-band–based breakdown with the ranges you suggested, and map:

* What works well in that band (driver + cabinet combos)
* Quality / effectiveness (good, poor, experimental, etc.)
* Price range (cheap, moderate, high-end, exotic/very expensive)

*  20–40 Hz (Deep Bass): Dynamic subwoofers (15–21"), ported or horn-loaded; transmission line designs.
*  40–60 Hz (Upper Sub-Bass): Dynamic woofers in sealed or ported boxes; transmission lines.
*  60–100 Hz (Bass / Kick Drum Range): Woofers (8–12") in sealed or ported enclosures; floor-standing tower speakers.
*  100–200 Hz (Upper Bass / Low Mids): Woofers and mid-woofers (5–8") in sealed or ported enclosures.
*  200–800 Hz (Midrange / Vocal Fundamentals): Dynamic midrange drivers (3–6"); planar magnetic / electrostatic panels for high-end.
*  800 Hz – 1 kHz (Upper Mids, Vocal Presence): Dynamic midrange; AMTs can cross in here; planar magnetic.
*  1–2 kHz (Mid-Treble Transition): Midrange drivers crossing to tweeters; AMTs or ribbons for high-end clarity.
*  2–3 kHz (Treble / Presence Region): Tweeters (domes, ribbons, AMTs); piezos (budget).
*  3–15 kHz (Upper Treble / Detail, “Airiness”): Dome tweeters (silk, metal, beryllium), ribbon tweeters, AMTs, electrostatics.
*  15–20 kHz (Super Tweeter Region): Ribbons, AMTs, supertweeters (beryllium domes, horn-loaded drivers).
*  20–30 kHz (Ultrasonic, Beyond Hearing for Most): Ribbons, AMTs, plasma tweeters.

Prices:
* Tactile shakers = cheap–moderate
* rotary subs = exotic/very expensive.
* “infrasonic” capable subs are expensive (\$1k–\$10k)
* good 12–18" subs = \$300–\$2000
* \$150–\$800 typical for dynamic woofers, Moderate to cheap; even budget systems cover this decently.
* Woofers and mid-woofers (5–8") are Cheap to moderate
* Dynamic cone midrange drivers (3–6") = cheap–moderate
* Planar magnetic / electrostatic panels = high-end
* ribbons/AMTs = higher end
* tweeter Domes = cheap–moderate
* teweters (ribbons/AMT) = high-end
* piezos = budget / cheap
* beryllium, exotic materials = expensive.
* plasma tweeters very expensive.

Quality / effectiveness:
* Anything Subsonic: Poor for airborne sound (air doesn’t couple well at these wavelengths). Only good for *feeling* vibrations.
* Extreme Low Bass / Infrasonics: good quality requires huge cabinets or multiple subs.
* Subwoofers Very good at low bass with proper cabinet; this is the sweet spot for home theater and EDM subs.
* **Price:** Moderate to high (good 12–18" subs = \$300–\$2000).

### **40–60 Hz (Upper Sub-Bass)**

* **Best solutions:** Dynamic woofers in sealed or ported boxes; transmission lines.
* **Quality:** Easier to reproduce; sealed boxes give tight bass, ported extend lower with more output.
* **Price:** Moderate (\$150–\$800 typical).

---

### **60–100 Hz (Bass / Kick Drum Range)**

* **Best solutions:** Woofers (8–12") in sealed or ported enclosures; floor-standing tower speakers.
* **Quality:** Most mid-size systems handle this well.
* **Price:** Moderate to cheap; even budget systems cover this decently.

---

### **100–200 Hz (Upper Bass / Low Mids)**

* **Best solutions:** Woofers and mid-woofers (5–8") in sealed or ported enclosures.
* **Quality:** Good; balanced output possible. Room acoustics matter.
* **Price:** Cheap to moderate.

---

### **200–800 Hz (Midrange / Vocal Fundamentals)**

* **Best solutions:** Dynamic midrange drivers (3–6"); planar magnetic / electrostatic panels for high-end.
* **Quality:** Critical range for clarity and naturalness; planar/electrostatic excels here.
* **Price:** Cones = cheap–moderate; planar/electrostatic = high.

---

### **800 Hz – 1 kHz (Upper Mids, Vocal Presence)**

* **Best solutions:** Dynamic midrange; AMTs can cross in here; planar magnetic.
* **Quality:** Most speaker types handle this, but crossover region can cause coloration.
* **Price:** Similar to above; more about crossover design than raw driver cost.

---

### **1–2 kHz (Mid-Treble Transition)**

* **Best solutions:** Midrange drivers crossing to tweeters; AMTs or ribbons for high-end clarity.
* **Quality:** Tricky crossover point; bad design = harshness.
* **Price:** Wide range; ribbons/AMTs = higher end.

---

### **2–3 kHz (Treble / Presence Region)**

* **Best solutions:** Tweeters (domes, ribbons, AMTs); piezos (budget).
* **Quality:** Dome tweeters do well; ribbons/AMTs excel in detail; piezos are cheap but harsh.
* **Price:** Domes = cheap–moderate; ribbons/AMTs = high.

---

### **3–15 kHz (Upper Treble / Detail, “Airiness”)**

* **Best solutions:** Dome tweeters (silk, metal, beryllium), ribbon tweeters, AMTs, electrostatics.
* **Quality:** High quality possible; good tweeters here define system detail.
* **Price:** Domes = moderate; beryllium, ribbons, AMTs = expensive.

---

### **15–20 kHz (Super Tweeter Region)**

* **Best solutions:** Ribbons, AMTs, supertweeters (beryllium domes, horn-loaded drivers).
* **Quality:** Audible for young ears, contributes to “sparkle.”
* **Price:** High for exotic materials.

---

### **20–30 kHz (Ultrasonic, Beyond Hearing for Most)**

* **Best solutions:** Ribbons, AMTs, plasma tweeters.
* **Quality:** Mostly marketing or for high-resolution systems; little perceptual impact.
* **Price:** Exotic; plasma tweeters very expensive.

---

### **30–40 kHz (Ultrasonic Extension)**

* **Best solutions:** Plasma tweeters, ribbons, AMTs.
* **Quality:** Useful for research, not human hearing.
* **Price:** Exotic/experimental.

---

### **40–100 kHz (Far Ultrasonic)**

* **Best solutions:** Plasma tweeters, specialized lab transducers, thermoacoustic devices.
* **Quality:** Not audible; may affect recordings via intermodulation.
* **Price:** Exotic, lab-grade.

---

### **>100 kHz (Beyond Audio)**

* **Best solutions:** Thermoacoustic, ultrasonic piezo transducers.
* **Quality:** Scientific applications (sonar, ultrasound), not music.
* **Price:** Lab equipment, specialized.

---

⚡ **Summary**:

* **Below 40 Hz** → Dynamic subs + big boxes, or tactile devices (\$\$\$).
* **40 Hz – 200 Hz** → Dynamic woofers in standard enclosures (affordable to moderate).
* **200 Hz – 2 kHz** → Midrange cones (budget) or planar/electrostatic (high-end).
* **2 kHz – 20 kHz** → Tweeters (domes = affordable, ribbons/AMT = high-end).
* **20 kHz+** → Mostly exotic tech, little audible benefit, very expensive.

Do you want me to **add cabinet recommendations inline with each band** (e.g. “20–40 Hz → ported or horn best, sealed not ideal”)? That way it’s a true “design guide by frequency band.”
