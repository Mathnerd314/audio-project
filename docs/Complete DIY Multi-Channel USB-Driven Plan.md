# Complete DIY Multi-Channel USB-Driven Speaker System Plan

## Overview and Workflow
This guide details a step-by-step pathway—from parts procurement through assembly, wiring, enclosure, and DSP setup—to build a cost-effective, scalable USB-driven active-crossover speaker system. Start with a 4- or 8-channel prototype, then expand to 16+ channels for a full 7.1.4 Atmos configuration.

***

## 1. Shopping List

### A. USB-to-I²S Interface
- 2 × XMOS XCORE-200 Multichannel USB-I²S/DSD/SPDIF PCBs (DIYinHK, includes USB cable)

### B. DAC + Amplifier Modules (per stereo channel)
- PCM5102A I²S DAC breakout board (qty = ½ total channels; e.g., 8 boards for 16 channels)
- XH-M562 TPA3116D2 amplifier board with potentiometer (qty = ½ total channels)
- I²S ribbon cable (IDC 10-pin, 1 m lengths; qty = number of boards; keep I²S clock (BCLK, LRCLK, DATA) trace lengths matched and under 30 cm where possible to prevent signal degradation)
- Speaker wire (14 AWG, 100 ft spool)

### C. Power Supplies & Accessories
- 24 V DC, 6 A switching power supply (1 × for up to 16 channels)
- 24 V DC, 10 A switching power supply (for >16 channels)
- DC power distribution bus bars or terminal blocks
- Ferrite beads (200 Ω @ 100 MHz, small surface-mount; qty = number of boards × 2)
- Low-noise LDO regulators (e.g., 3.3 V, 1.8 V; optional for custom PCBs)

### D. Tools and Enclosures
- Soldering station with fine tip and temperature control
- Wire stripper/crimper and solder wick
- Drill and chassis punch set (for jack, potentiometer, LED holes)
- Metal enclosures (e.g., Hammond 1590 series; qty based on module grouping)
- IDC crimp tool for ribbon connectors
- Zip ties, nylon standoffs, M3/M4 screws, and nuts

### E. DSP & Software
- PC with Windows/Linux/macOS
- Equalizer APO (Windows) or open-source alternative
- REW (Room EQ Wizard) for measurements
- Optional: VST host (Cantabile, Reaper, etc.)

## 2. Preparation and Prototype Build

### Step 1: Unpack & Inspect Modules
1. Verify each XMOS board powers on via USB (green LED).
2. Confirm PCM5102A and TPA3116D2 boards are intact and potentiometers turn smoothly.

### Step 2: Configure XMOS Boards
1. Connect one XMOS board via USB to PC; install any UAC2 drivers if required.
2. Update firmware to latest version supporting your desired channel count.
3. Using XMOS configuration utility, set output channels to I²S/PCM mode (e.g., 16 × I²S lanes).

### Step 3: Wire I²S Ribbon to DAC Boards
1. Cut ribbon cable into 10-pin segments, one per PCM5102A board.
2. On each breakout, solder or attach IDC connector:
   - Pin mapping: BCLK, LRCLK, DATA, VDD, GND, plus NC pins.
3. Route ribbon from XMOS outputs, bundling lanes by group of two (stereo).

### Step 4: Connect DAC Outputs to Amplifiers
1. Use short, shielded pair to route each PCM5102A line-out to TPA3116D2 board input.
2. Twist and shield these analog runs; secure ferrite beads on power input of each amp board.

### Step 5: Power Distribution
1. Mount switching supply inside an enclosure or rack.
2. Distribute 24 V DC to each amplifier board via bus bars or terminal blocks.
3. Tie all grounds at a single star-point near the supply.

### Step 6: Speaker Wiring
1. Terminate 14 AWG speaker wire with banana plugs or spade lugs.
2. Label each run for channel identification (e.g., FL, FR, C, Ls, Rs).

## 3. Enclosure and Assembly

1. Group modules into manageable enclosure units (e.g., 4 stereo channels per box).
2. Drill holes for power entry, potentiometer shafts, status LEDs, and I²S cable glands.
3. Mount PCBs on nylon standoffs, maintain 5 mm clearance around inductors.
4. Bundle internal wiring neatly; use zip-ties and routing clips.
5. Install front-panel gain pots; label each channel knob.
6. Secure enclosure covers, maintain chassis grounding to LED grounds.

## 4. Software Setup and Calibration

### Step 1: Install DSP Software
1. On PC, install Equalizer APO or alternative.
2. Confirm Windows audio device shows 16 or more channels on the XMOS interface.

### Step 2: Measurement and Crossover
1. Place measurement microphone at listening position; launch REW.
2. Measure each driver’s response; design FIR or IIR crossover filters in REW.
3. Export filter coefficients; load into Equalizer APO’s config for each channel.

### Step 3: Level and Delay Alignment
1. Play pink noise on each channel, observe levels in REW; use hardware pots for coarse trims.
2. Fine-tune levels and time alignment in DSP with sub-dB and sub-0.1 ms precision.

### Step 4: Save and Automate Profiles
1. Create presets for Atmos 7.1.4, stereo monitoring, and subwoofer integration.
2. Automate profile loading via command-line or playback software.

## 5. Expansion and Optimization

- **Adding Channels:** Simply procure additional PCM5102A + TPA3116D2 pairs, wire to the second XMOS board, and expand power supply capacity.
- **Upgrading Fidelity:** Replace PCM5102A boards with CS4398 or CS42526 modules on a custom PCB once channel-count and proof-of-concept are established.
- **Custom PCBs:** After prototyping, design a multi-channel DAC/AMP stack-up PCB, integrating power regulation and I²S lanes to reduce wiring complexity.

**By following this plan**, a functional 16-channel active multi-way speaker system can be completed with minimal custom fabrication, leveraging off-the-shelf USB audio and DIY audio modules. This approach ensures precise synchronization, flexible DSP-based crossover control, and a clear upgrade path to higher channel counts or improved audio fidelity.
