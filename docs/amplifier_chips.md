### Expanded Descriptions

#### AP3050D / CS8683H
- **Type**: Class D Audio Power Amplifier (often found as relabeled clones)
- **Specs**: THD ~0.1% at 500mW, peaks at high frequency/power; usually a knockoff of TPA3116D2 lineage.
- **Application**: Cheap, budget boards (XY-T100L style). Use for moderate performance but expect more distortion at >10W or high frequencies.
- AP3050D datasheet is not online, but poking around suggests it is a relabeled CS8683H. https://www.diyaudio.com/community/threads/coffee-money-xy-aph15-15w-bt-5-0-amp.383499/post-6970109
- seems to be a knockoff of the TPA3116D2, on boards such as XY-T100L. https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/2021-is-almost-done-with-so-amp-review-with-a-twist.29522/page-2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7WgBavvQO0
- boards with H suffix denote the 'imported' TI chip and locally sourced AP* have the the L suffix.
- https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806254704301.html
- according to CS8638H data sheet, minimum THD is 0.1% at 500 mW. Distortion is < 0.01% below 800Hz, but 0.1% in 3kHz - 10 kHz band http://www.szczkjgs.com/UploadFiles/fujian/4906/CS8683.pdf

#### CS8673E
- **Type**: Dual Class D, 40Wx2 @ 8Ω, 5–26V supply
- **Features**: Spread spectrum EMI, auto-mute, cooling via PCB pad—not suitable for high-voltage with poor thermal design.
- **Performance**: THD+N 0.03% @ 600mW, increases at higher output. Power-on pop—control via enable pin suggested.
    - Dual-channel Class D audio power amplifier, **5V–26V** supply voltage, **8Ω** load impedance. **40 W x 2** max stereo output power, up to 92% efficiency. Over-current, short-circuit, and over-heat protection; Spread spectrum function. https://en.eeworld.com.cn/bbs/thread-1188337-1-1.html
    - minimum THD+N is 0.03% at 600 mW 1kHz, total THD+N is 0.06% up to about 15W. < 0.03% up to about 600 Hz, strong peak of 50% THD at 5 kHz https://www.diyaudio.com/community/threads/difference-between-cs8673-and-tpa3116.405281/#post-7913882
    - No heat sink required. cooled via the metal thermal pad on the BOTTOM of the ESOP16 package - i.e.: the PCB! So ensure good thermal contact with thick PCB. These chips will certainly run without heatsink (on top) at lower voltages, but once you get above 12 volts, the chip starts running (idle even) warm. At 19-24 volts, these chips REALLY heat up (even at idle). But driving them hard at 24 volts has resulted in zero failures thus far.
    - less idle hiss than the 3116 chips, probably due to auto-shutoff. nasty power-on pop. recommend manually controlling the power-up and power-down via the "enable" pin (pin 4). https://www.diyaudio.com/community/threads/difference-between-cs8673-and-tpa3116.405281/
    - I now prefer these over the TPA3116 chips for low power or midbass -> trebble duty (80Hz on up).

These parts are generally available only as bare chips, requiring custom PCB design—I'm leaving them out on the table in case the project gets enough interest for a group buy, but they're not my top choices at the moment.

- 7805: Classic 5V regulator.
- Fans: Required for high-power amp builds to ensure longevity and stable performance.

- TAS5760M: discussed in https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/class-d-amplifier-with-digital-inputs.22009/page-2 - most products still use typical DAC to class D method, a digital-input class D amp is still rare and it is not clear if it offers any sonic advantage. a more complex topology https://www.ti.com.cn/cn/lit/an/slaa117a/slaa117a.pdf is better, but still not great, THD+N 0.04% and it requires a custom PCB.

### Section 6: Design and Selection Notes

- Class-D chips (TPA series, IRS, MA5332, PAM8403) offer high efficiency and compact form factor, but require careful thermal and EMI design at higher output.
- Class-AB chips (LM3886, TDA2030A, TDA1308) yield classic analog sound but with lower efficiency–best for smaller builds or headphone use.
- Many clones and relabels exist (AP3050D/CS8683H, TPA3116D2 knockoffs); always verify via PCB photos and datasheets.
- For system architecture, digital-input Class-D remains rare; most use a DAC > analog input > Class-D chain, with only a few chips supporting direct digital PWM—often with modest sonic gain.
- Power supply selection (LM2596, 7805) must be matched to amp chip voltage and load, with adequate filtering and heatsinking.
